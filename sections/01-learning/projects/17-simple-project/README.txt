README.txt

This is almost the same as our 'Hello' example.

This project has a single main.cpp
You can create the builds files by typing: ./generate.sh
Build by typing: cmake --build build

This will create the executable 'simple'.

It is possible to run 'make' directly, but the recommended way is
to use cmake. The reason being, it's not a 'generator independent' way
of building.
